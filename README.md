# PaintingInCode

This was a personal project that I was very passionate about and resilient with. 
This was created when I was first starting to learn how to code graphics. 
This project showed me that my only limit was my imagination when it came to coding.
It is an easter home and I used pygame to create all of the images myself. 
I applied all the basics of code I learnt such as if and for statements and loops, and created this image.
